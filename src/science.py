    - Read all files.
    - Subtract the bias frame from the science frame.
    - Subtract the dark frame from the science frame. Remember to multiply the
      dark frame by the exposure time of the science frame. The exposure time can
      be found in the header of the FITS file.
    - Correct the science frame using the flat frame.
    - Optionally, remove cosmic rays.
    - Save the resulting reduced science frame to a FITS file with the filename
      reduced_science_filename.
    - Return the reduced science frame as a 2D numpy array.
